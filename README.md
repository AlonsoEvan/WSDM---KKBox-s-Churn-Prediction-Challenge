# WSDM---KKBox-s-Churn-Prediction-Challenge
Kaggle project

The 11th ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining (WSDM 2018) is challenging Kaggler to build an algorithm that predicts whether a subscription user will churn using a donated dataset from KKBOX.

In this competition we’re tasked to build an algorithm that predicts whether a user will churn after their subscription expires. Currently, the company uses survival analysis techniques to determine the residual membership life time for each subscriber. 
By adopting different methods, KKBOX anticipates they’ll discover new insights to why users leave so they can be proactive in keeping users dancing.
